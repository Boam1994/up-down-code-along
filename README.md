# Up/Down Code-Along

A simple little website where users can increase and decrease a value.  The User Interface (DOM & Styles) are provided.  You need to add user interactions one step at a time:

1. __setup__: (done for you)
1. __data & log__: (done for you)
1. __initialize__: log initial state, and render initial state to the UI
1. __up__: a user can increase the current number by a value of their choice
1. __down__: a user can decrease the current number by a value of their choice
1. __reset__: a user can reset state & the DOM back to their initial values
